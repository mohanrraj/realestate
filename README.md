### Latest Updates

### **Project Cards Fixed!**

### **Image Display Logic Resolved**
- **Exclusive Display**: Now only shows EITHER the real image OR the placeholder, never both
- **Proper Image Loading**: Images fade in smoothly when loaded successfully (`opacity: 0` → `opacity: 1`)
- **Smart Fallback**: Placeholders only appear when images fail to load
- **Clean Transitions**: Smooth switching between image and placeholder states
- **Enhanced Event Handling**: Proper `onload` and `onerror` event management

### **Visual Improvements**
- **Project Cards**: Only display the successful image or the colorful placeholder
- **Modal Display**: Modal properly shows the same image that was clicked
- **Consistent Styling**: Unified approach between cards and modal
- **Better UX**: No more confusing dual display of image + placeholder

### **Technical Implementation**
- **Image Loading States**: Proper handling of loading, success, and error states
- **Dynamic Display Logic**: Conditional visibility based on image availability
- **Clean Code Structure**: Improved JavaScript with better error handling
- **Memory Efficient**: Proper cleanup of unused elements
